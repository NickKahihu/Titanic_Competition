# Titanic Competition from Kaggle

*The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)*

## Goal:
This competition requires the use of machine learning to create a model that predicts whether or not a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Major Steps Taken:
Loading data

Cleaning data

Exploring the data through visualization

Choosing the best model to use

Hyperparameter tuning of the best model

Making the predictions and submitting to Kaggle
